I bought [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) by [@ericries](https://twitter.com/ericries) in December 2011 and read it in one sitting. As a software engineer more interested in *actually* building products rathen than playing with every fancy new technology that pops up on <acronym title="Hacker News">HN</acronym>, this book really resonated with me.

Through an introspection job, I came to the conclusion that I perform best as a second in command. I have buying in the light but I love being at the very edge, still in darkness - *did you know I play the bass? symptomatic isn't it? :)*. Hence I read this book not thinking as an entrepreneur-wannabe-CEO, but more as the product/technical guy who can help the company driver. Here are the notes of my second read.
