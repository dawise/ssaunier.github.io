I bought [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) by [@ericries](https://twitter.com/ericries) in December 2011 and read it in one sitting. As a software engineer more interested in *actually* building products rathen than playing with every fancy new technology that pops up on <acronym title="Hacker News">HN</acronym>, this book really resonated with me.

Through an introspection job, I came to the conclusion that I perform best as a second in command. I hate being in the spotlight but I love being at the very edge, still in darkness - *did you know I [play the bass](http://www.takone.fr)? symptomatic isn't it? :)*. Hence I read this book not thinking as an entrepreneur-wannabe-CEO, but more as the product/technical guy accountable for the way the product is built. Here are my notes.

## Part One - Vision

### Start

Key concepts:

- If people don't want to buy your product, there is no point of delivering on time and on budget
- Short cycle times must be used at all time to improve the product
- Run a startup like you drive a car (tight feedback loop), not like a rocket (in-advance calibration)

### Define

The most important **definition** of the book:

> A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

This defintion is great as it can apply to *garage entrepreneurs*, the ones you know well, and *intrapreneurs*, those who operate inside established organization.

### Learn

"Learning" is the oldest excuse for justifying a failure of execution, of meeting a plan. The new key concept of Lean Startup is **validated learning**, backed up by empirical data collected from real customers. The idea is to plan the learning, not to put up with "learning" after failure.

The question is not "Can this product be built?" but "Should this product be built? Will it have a sustainable business around?".

> To answer those questions, we need a method for systematically breaking down a business plan into its component parts and testing each part empirically. In other words, we need the **scientific method**. In the Lean Startup model, every product, every feature, every marketing campaign \[...\] is understood to be an experiment designed to achieve validated learning.

### Experiment

If you just release, you're sure to succeed at seeing the result (and that's all).

> If you cannot fail, you cannot learn.

Lean Startup validated learning method is inspired by the [Scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), expressing a clear hypothesis then building an experiment to validate/invalidate this hypothesis.

The first exemple of this chapter is [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/). His founder Nick Swinmurn had the vision of e-commerce for clothes in the late 90's. His hypothesis was that customers were willing to buy shoes online. He ran a simple experiment, taking pictures of shoes in a regular store, posting them online, and coming back later to buy the shoes at full price from that same store when a customer happened to buy online. This kind of experiment is called a *Concierge <acronym title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</acronym>* (more on that later).

In the traditional word, the product manager would say he wants feature X, and then the engineer would answer that's possible, I'll build X. Eric Ries pushes his team to answer three questions before:

> 1. Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?
> 2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?
> 3. Would they buy it from us?
> 4. Can we build a solution for that problem?


## Part Two - Steer

This part is about the **Build → Measure → Learn** loop (diagram created by [KISSmetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.com)). As this is the core of the Lean Startup model, here is the big picture:

  <img src="/images/posts/build-measure-learn.png" alt="Build Measure Learn loop" width="100%" />
</a>

In a regular team, you have

- **Engineers**, very efficient at building things
- **Managers**, experts at strategizing and learning at the whiteboard
- **Entrepreneurs**, with big ideas

For a startup to succeed, those people need to work hand in hand and minimize the *total* amount of time through the loop. Here is a general pattern:

1. You had a great **Idea**. Now test your riskiest hypothesis, the *leap-of-faith* assumptions, which are the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis
2. Enter the **Build** phase quickly with a <acronym title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</acronym>. Must get in front of potential customers. Might try to sell it.
3. The **Measure** phase is tricky. Metrics have to be chosen beforehand carefully to actually measure a progress. More on the pitfall of *vanity metrics* later.
4. If tested assumption is false => **PIVOT**. Otherwise **PERSEVERE**. Then back to 1.

### Leap

Facebook validated his two *leap-of-faith* questions in the first months of its existence. More than half of the users came back to the site every single day (**value**), and had three-quarters of Harvard's undergraduates using it within one month without any advertising (**growth**).

Basic strategic decisions need firsthand understanding of customers. Toyota calls it *genchi gembutsu*, Japanese for "go and see for yourself". That's why the [Lean Startup Machine](http://leanstartupmachine.com/) workshops preach the motto "Get Out of The Building" to very attendee-wannabe-entrepreneur.

### Test

Too much analysis is dangerous. None can lead to failure. The solution is the <acronym title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</acronym>.

Exemple of Groupon: their first MVP was a WordPress blog selling a T-shirt. Coupons were generated using FileMaker, and a script would email it to people.

The goal of the MVP is to help entrepreneurs start learning ASAP. It is built in a way to minimize the time through the Build-Measure-Learn, hence with the minimal effort. His goal is to test fundamental business hypothesis.

Here are examples of MVP techniques:

- **Video**: famous exemple fo [Dropbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFb0NaeRmdg), a simple narration of a story people can relate to. Overnight, their waiting list for the beta went from 5,000 to 75,000 people. This validate the *leap-of-faith* value hypothesis.
- **Concierge**: faking the product by a personalized service designed as a learning activity. It will test the growth model systematically with real customers. This cuts out 95% of the development time by focusing on just one use case (one person).

### Measure
### Pivot (or Persevere)

## Part Three - Accelerate

## Batch
## Grow
## Adapt
## Innovate
