I bought [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) by [@ericries](https://twitter.com/ericries) in December 2011 and read it in one sitting. As a software engineer more interested in *actually* building products rathen than playing with every fancy new technology that pops up on <acronym title="Hacker News">HN</acronym>, this book really resonated with me.

Through an introspection job, I came to the conclusion that I perform best as a second in command. I have buying in the light but I love being at the very edge, still in darkness - *did you know I play the bass? symptomatic isn't it? :)*. Hence I read this book not thinking as an entrepreneur-wannabe-CEO, but more as the product/technical accountable for the way the product is built. Here are my notes.

## Part One - Vision

### Start

Key concepts:

1. If people don't want to buy your product, there is no point of delivering on time and on budget.
2. Short feedback loop must be used at all time to improve the product
3. Run a startup like you drive a car (tight feedback loop), not like a rock (in-advance calibration).

### Define

In Eric Ries' own words:

> A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

This defintion is great as it can apply to *garage entrepreneurs*, the ones you know well, and *intrapreneurs*, those who operate inside established organization.
