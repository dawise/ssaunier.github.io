I bought [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) by [@ericries](https://twitter.com/ericries) in December 2011 and read it in one sitting. As a software engineer more interested in *actually* building products rathen than playing with every fancy new technology that pops up on <acronym title="Hacker News">HN</acronym>, this book really resonated with me.

Through an introspection job, I came to the conclusion that I perform best as a second in command. I have buying in the light but I love being at the very edge, still in darkness - *did you know I play the bass? symptomatic isn't it? :)*. Hence I read this book not thinking as an entrepreneur-wannabe-CEO, but more as the product/technical accountable for the way the product is built. Here are my notes.

## Part One - Vision

### Start

Key concepts:

- If people don't want to buy your product, there is no point of delivering on time and on budget
- Short cycle times must be used at all time to improve the product
- Run a startup like you drive a car (tight feedback loop), not like a rocket (in-advance calibration)

### Define

The most important **definition** of the book:

> A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

This defintion is great as it can apply to *garage entrepreneurs*, the ones you know well, and *intrapreneurs*, those who operate inside established organization.

### Learn

"Learning" is the oldest excuse for justifying a failure of execution, of meeting a plan. The new key concept of Lean Startup is **validated learning**, backed up by empirical data collected from real customers. The idea is to plan the learning, not to put up with "learning" after failure.

The question is not "Can this product be built?" but "Should this product be built? Will it have a sustainable business around?".

> To answer those questions, we need a method for systematically breaking down a business plan into its component parts and testing each part empirically. In other words, we need the **scientific method**. In the Lean Startup model, every product, every feature, every marketing campaign \[...\] is understood to be an experiment designed to achieve validated learning.

### Experiment

If you just release, you're sure to succeed at seeing the result (and that's all).

> If you cannot fail, you cannot learn.

Lean Startup validated learning method is inspired by the [Scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), expressing a clear hypothesis then building an experiment to validate/invalidate this hypothesis.

The first exemple of this chapter is [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/). His founder Nick Swinmurn had the vision of e-commerce for clothes in the late 90's. His hypothesis was that customers were willing to buy shoes online. He ran a simple experiment, taking pictures of shoes in a regular store, posting them online, and coming back later to buy the shoes at full price from that same store when a customer happened to buy online. This kind of experiment is called a *Concierge <acronym title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</acronym>*.
